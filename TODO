- make lists immutable?
- list optimization: don't copy append operations just refer to the previous 
list?
- add error handling (aka. throwing)
- __call metamethod overridin, thus List(1,2,3,4) would be possible !!! This is
partially done, not very neat
- create rockspec
- make functions use foldr/foldl instead of iteration (even though it is
faster)
