- make lists immutable?
- list optimization: don't copy append operations just refer to the previous 
list?
- add error handling (aka. throwing)
- add more specs (specifying afterwards doesn't really make any sense :) )
- function currying, e.g. list:map()(function(n)... instead of current
list:map(function...)
- __call metamethod overridin, thus List(1,2,3,4) would be possible !!! This is
partially done, not very neat
- create rockspec
- foldl
